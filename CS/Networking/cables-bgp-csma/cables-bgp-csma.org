* Cables
  Most common network cables are
** cat5
   electrical pulses over copper wires wrapped in plastic
** cat5e
   + reduces crosstalk
   + less likely to retransmit data
   + faster/more data transmitted on average
** cat6
   + even less crosstalk
   - expensive
   - shorter max distance at higher speeds (before data transmission becomes unreliable)
** fiber
   + resistant to electromagnetic signals
   + fastest data transport
   + longer max distance (before data transmission becomes unreliable)
   - fragile
   - expensive
* Collision Domain
  network segment where only one device can communicate at a time
* Hub vs Switch vs Router
| Device | Layer     | Protocol |
|--------+-----------+----------|
| Hub    | Physical  | Bits     |
| Switch | Data Link | Ethernet |
| Router | Network   | IP       |
* Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
  used by routers to determine the most efficient route to send data to a destination
  path vector routing protocol
  runs on a 6-state finite state machine(FSM)
** Idle
   refuses all incoming BGP connections
   initializes event triggers
   initializes TCP connection with configured BGP peer
   listens for TCP connection with configured BGP peer
   changes state to Connect
*** Possible Issues -> returns to Idle
    TCP port 179 is not open
    random TCP port >1023 not open (?)
    peer address configured incorrectly on either router
    autonomous system number configured incorrectly on either router
** Connect
   waits for successful TCP negotiation with peer
   sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent
*** Possible Issues -> changes to Active
    same as Idle possible issues
** Active
   restarts TCP connection to peer
   sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent
*** Possible Issues -> returns to Idle
    same as Idle possible issues
    network congestion
    flapping network interface
** OpenSent
   listens for Open message from peer
   checks validity of message
   sends KeepAlive message to peer
   sets timers (60 sec?,?)
   changes state to OpenConfirm
*** Possible Issues -> sends Notification error message to peer
    1 or more fields in Open message don't match configuration
** OpenConfirm
   listens for KeepAlive message from peer
   change state to Established
*** Possible Issues -> returns to Idle
    timer expires before KeepAlive message
    error condition occurs
** Established
   sends Update message to peer to exchange information about all routes advertised to peer
*** Possible Issues -> sends Notification message to peer, returns to Idle
    error in Update message
* Tip for troubleshooting malfunctioning network connections
  if what should be a full-duplex connection reports as a half-duplex,
  something is probably wrong with its configuration
* RJ45
  usually have 2 small lights
** Link light
   lit when cable is connected to another device and both devices are on
** Activity light
   flashes when data is actively being transferred
   Trivia: previously flashed in binary sequence as data was transferred,
     no longer does as transfer speeds are too high (probably security as well)
* Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
  if no activity is detected on network, send packet
  if packet collides with another packet, stop sending it
  wait random amount of time
  resend packet
* MAC address
  48 bits long
  24 bits - Organizationally Unique Identifier
  24 bits - Unique Manufacturer ID
* Unicast vs Multicast vs Broadcast
  check the least significant bit (LSB)
** LSB is 0
   unicast
   Ethernet frame intended for single destination
   still sent to all devices in collision domain
   only received and processed by intended destination address
** LSB is 1
   multicast
   sent to everyone
   accepted or discarded based on each receiving host's configuration
** entire destination address is Fs
   broadcast
   used so devices on network can learn more about other devices
   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
* Ethernet Frame
** Data packet
   any kind of binary data being sent over a network link
** Anatomy of an Ethernet frame
*** Preamble - 64 bits
**** Bit-Level Clock Synchronizer - 56 bits
**** Start Frame Delimiter(SFD) - 8 bits
*** Header - 112-144 bits
**** MAC destination - 48 bits
**** MAC source - 48 bits
**** 802.1Q/802.1ad tag(optional) - 0 or 32 bits
**** EtherType/Length - 16 bits
     if value is <1500, indicates length of payload in bytes
     if value is >1536, indicates EtherType
       length of payload determined by location of interpacket gap and FCS
*** Payload - 42/46-1500 bytes
    42 is minimum if 802.1Q/802.1ad tag is present
    46 is minimum if 802.1Q/802.1ad tag is not present
    if payload is less than minimum, payload is padded out
*** Frame Check Sequence (FCS) - 32 bits
    Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
    hash of the rest of the frame
    bit-flipped during sending to avoid a specific false positive situation
      if the (hash?) has trailing zeroes it would result in a (possibly
      incorrect) zero remainder
