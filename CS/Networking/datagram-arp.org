* IP datagram
  the payload of an Ethernet frame
** Header - 20+ bytes (160+ bits)
*** 4 bits - IP version
    IPv4 vs IPv6
*** 4 bits - Internet Header Length (IHL)
    x * 4 bytes (32-bit words)
    default value is 5
    5 * 4 bytes = 20 bytes
*** 8 bits - Differentiated Services (DS)
    indicates what type of traffic packet is for (ex. streaming vs email)
*** 16 bits - Total Length (TL)
    length of entire datagram in bytes
*** 16 bits - Identification
    used by recipient to reassemble full message from fragments
      spread out over multiple packets
*** 3 bits - Flags
**** 1 bit - Don't Fragment (DF)
     usually used for testing Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
**** 1 bit - More Fragments (MF)
***** 0
      last fragment of message OR
      no fragmentation of message
***** 1
      message is fragmented
      packet with this flag is not the last fragment
**** 1 bit - Reserved
     currently unused
*** 13 bits - Fragment Offset
    order of fragments
    each fragment will have a different value
    when reassembled in order, will constitute full message
*** 16 bits - Time To Live (TTL)
    how many network hops the datagram can take before being dropped
    decrements after each hop so future hops know when to drop it
*** 8 bits - Protocol
| Hex | Dec | Protocol | Use                                      |
|-----+-----+----------+------------------------------------------|
|  00 |   0 | Reserved | N/A                                      |
|  01 |   1 | ICMP     | mostly one-way diagnostics and errors    |
|  02 |   2 | IGMP     | used to establish multicast membership   |
|  03 |   3 | GGP      | obsolete alternative to TCP/UDP          |
|  04 |   4 | IP-in-IP | encapsulate IP packet in IP packet       |
|  06 |   6 | TCP      | reliable byte transmission over network  |
|  08 |   8 | EGP      | unused routing protocol                  |
|  11 |  17 | UDP      | faster but unreliable byte transmission  |
|  32 |  50 | ESP      | provides auth, integrity, and protection |
|  33 |  51 | AH       | authenticates origin and integrity       |
*** 16 bits - Header Checksum
    simple checksum of datagram
    checked at each hop
    datagram is discarded if this fails (assumed data corruption)
*** 32 bits - Source IP Address
*** 32 bits - Destination IP Address
*** Options
    very rarely used, feel free to skip this section
**** 8 bits - Option-Type
***** 1 bit - Copied Flag
****** 0
       indicates option is NOT to be copied to fragments if data is fragmented
****** 1
       indicates option is to be copied to fragments if fragmented
***** 2 bits - Option Class
****** 0
       default
       "Control"
****** 2
       used for debugging
       measurement used for Internet Timestamp option (?)
***** 5 bits - Option Number
****** 0
       special case indicating the end of the options field
         this means there are no Option Length or Option Data fields
****** 1 - No Operation
       same as 0
****** 2 - Security
       sets option length to 11 bytes (88 bits)
       used to carry security, compartmentation, user group, and
         handling restriction codes for compliance with US DoD
****** 3 - Loose Source Routing
       provides specific routes that datagram can be routed through
       records route information
****** 4 - Internet Timestamp
       records when (but not where) it gets to each hop
       the device at each hop adds a new timestamp to this option
       size set by source
       cannot be enlarged
       if datagram reaches next hop and there is no space left,
         overflow count is incremented
       if there is some space but not enough for another full timestamp OR
       if overflow count itself overflows
         datagram is considered in error and is discarded
         an ICMP parameter problem message may be sent to source
****** 7 - Record Route
       exactly what it sounds like
       the device at each hop adds its IP to this option
       size set by source
       cannot be enlarged
       just stops recording additional IPs if overflow occurs
****** 8 - Stream ID
       provides a way for the 16-bit SATNET stream ID to be carried through
         networks that don't support the stream concept
       must be copied on fragmentation
****** 9 - Strict Source Routing
       provides specific IP addresses that datagram can be routed to
       each hop MUST send the datagram directly to the next address
       records route information
****** 18 - Traceroute
       used in the enhanced implementation of traceroute
**** Option Length
     values for this are supplied in Option-Type field
**** Option Data
     what is stored here is dependent on the value of the Option-Type field
***** Security

       values are alphanumeric digraphs (8 of them?)
